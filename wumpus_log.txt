Reasoning: At the current position (0, 0), there are no perceptions indicating the presence of a Pit or Wumpus. The only available unvisited squares are (1, 0), (7, 0), (0, 1), and (0, 7). Moving to any of these squares is safe as there are no immediate dangers indicated.

Reasoning: I am currently at (0, 0) and perceive a breeze, indicating a pit in one of the adjacent squares. The possible moves are right to (1, 0), left to (7, 0), up to (0, 1), and down to (0, 7). Since I have already visited (0, 0), I cannot move back to it. Moving left to (7, 0) is not a good option because it is the farthest from the center and may not be the most efficient way to explore. Moving up to (0, 1) is also not ideal because it is the same row and may not be the best choice for exploration. Moving down to (0, 7) is not a good option because it is the farthest from the center and may not be the most efficient way to explore.

The agent has no perceptions at the current position, so there is no immediate danger from a Wumpus or Pit. The available unvisited moves are right to (0, 2), left to (6, 2), and up to (7, 3). Moving right to (0, 2) or left to (6, 2) are both safe and unvisited options. Moving up to (7, 3) is also unvisited and safe. Since there are no immediate dangers, the agent can choose any of these directions. To maximize exploration, the agent should move to (0, 2) as it is a new direction and unvisited.

Reasoning: The current position is (0, 2) and the agent has already visited (7, 2) in the last move. The agent has no perceptions at the current position, so there is no immediate danger from the Wumpus or Pit. The agent has arrows left, which can be used to shoot if there is a strong suspicion of a Wumpus. The possible moves from (0, 2) are right to (1, 2) (unvisited), left to (7, 2) (visited), up to (0, 3) (unvisited), and down to (0, 1) (unvisited). Since (7, 2) has already been visited, it is not a good option to move back to it. The agent should prioritize exploring safe, unvisited squares. Moving right to (1, 2) or up to (0, 3) are both safe and unvisited options. There is no strong reason to shoot at this point, as there are no perceptions indicating the presence of a Wumpus.

Reasoning: The agent is currently at (1, 2) and perceives a breeze, indicating a pit in one of the adjacent squares. The possible moves are right to (2, 2), left to (0, 2), up to (1, 3), and down to (1, 1). The left move to (0, 2) is not ideal as it is a visited cell and could potentially lead to a pit. The up move to (1, 3) and the down move to (1, 1) are both unvisited and safe options. Since the breeze indicates a pit, the agent should avoid moving into the adjacent square of the pit. The right move to (2, 2) is also a safe and unvisited option. Given the agent has arrows left, it can also consider shooting if it suspects a Wumpus in the adjacent squares. However, without a strong reason to suspect a Wumpus, the agent should prioritize exploring safe, unvisited squares.

Reasoning: The current position is (0, 0) and there is a stench indicating a Wumpus in an adjacent square. The possible moves are right to (1, 0), left to (7, 0), up to (0, 1), and down to (0, 7). Since the Wumpus is in an adjacent square, it is crucial to avoid moving into a square that could potentially be adjacent to the Wumpus. Moving right to (1, 0) or left to (7, 0) would place the agent in a square adjacent to the Wumpus, which is risky. Moving up to (0, 1) or down to (0, 7) would also place the agent in a square adjacent to the Wumpus. Therefore, the safest move is to shoot in the direction of the Wumpus to eliminate the threat. Since the Wumpus is in an adjacent square, shooting in any direction (right, left, up, or down) would be a reasonable choice. Given that the agent has 5 arrows left, it is safe to shoot in any direction.

Moving back to (0, 0) is not advisable due to the recent stench indicating a Wumpus nearby. Moving to (0, 2) is a safe, unvisited option. Moving to (1, 1) or (7, 1) could be risky as they are adjacent to the last visited position (0, 0) with a stench. Moving down to (0, 0) is also not advisable due to the stench. Since there are no perceptions at the current position, there is no immediate danger from a Wumpus or Pit. Therefore, the safest move is to (0, 2).

Reasoning: The current position is (0, 2) and the agent has already visited (0, 0), (0, 1), and (0, 2). The recent perceptions indicate a Wumpus presence at (0, 0) with multiple stench indications. Moving to (0, 1) is not advisable as it is a visited cell and there is a risk of encountering the Wumpus. The agent should avoid moving back to (0, 1) unless there is a strong reason. The possible moves are right to (1, 2), left to (7, 2), up to (0, 3), and down to (0, 1). Since (0, 1) is already visited and (0, 3) is unvisited, the agent should consider moving to (0, 3) to explore a new area. There is no indication of a pit or Wumpus in the current position, so it is safe to move to (0, 3). If the agent suspects a Wumpus, it can consider shooting in the direction of the Wumpus.

Moving back to (5, 0) is not advisable due to the potential risk of encountering a pit. The available unvisited options are (7, 0), (6, 1), and (6, 7). Moving to (7, 0) is a safe and unvisited option, and it is not adjacent to the previously visited (5, 0) where the breeze was detected. Moving to (6, 1) or (6, 7) could be considered, but (7, 0) is a more straightforward choice as it is directly to the right and not adjacent to the previously visited square. There is no indication of a Wumpus, so shooting is not necessary at this moment.

2025-03-27 13:42:57 - Hero at position: (7, 0)
2025-03-27 13:43:26 - LLM Raw Response:
Reasoning: The current position is (7, 0) and the agent has already visited the cells (0, 0) to (7, 0). The recent perceptions indicate a breeze at (3, 0), suggesting a pit nearby. The agent has 5 arrows left, which can be used to shoot if a Wumpus is suspected. The possible moves from (7, 0) are to (0, 0) (visited), (6, 0) (visited), (7, 1) (unvisited), and (7, 7) (unvisited). Moving back to (6, 0) is not advisable as it is a visited cell and the agent should avoid revisiting cells. Moving to (0, 0) or (6, 0) is also not ideal as they are visited cells. The safest and unvisited option is to move to (7, 1). There is no indication of a Wumpus or pit in the immediate vicinity, so shooting is not necessary at this moment. The agent should prioritize exploring the unvisited cell (7, 1) to continue the search for the Gold.

2025-03-27 13:43:27 - You feel a breeze...
2025-03-27 13:43:49 - LLM Raw Response:
Reasoning: The agent is currently at position (7, 1) and perceives a breeze, indicating a pit in an adjacent square. The possible moves are right to (0, 1), left to (6, 1), up to (7, 2), and down to (7, 0). Moving down to (7, 0) is not an option as it has already been visited. Moving up to (7, 2) is a safe, unvisited option. Moving right to (0, 1) and left to (6, 1) are also unvisited, but they are adjacent to the pit indicated by the breeze. Since the breeze indicates a pit in an adjacent square, moving to (0, 1) or (6, 1) could be risky. Therefore, the safest and most logical move is to go up to (7, 2).

2025-03-27 13:44:12 - LLM Raw Response:
Reasoning: The agent is currently at (7, 2) and perceives a stench, indicating the presence of a Wumpus in an adjacent square. The agent has already visited (7, 1) and encountered a breeze there, suggesting a nearby pit. The possible moves are to (0, 2), (6, 2), (7, 3), and (7, 1). Moving to (7, 1) is not advisable due to the breeze indicating a pit. Moving to (0, 2) or (6, 2) are unvisited and safe options. Moving up to (7, 3) is also unvisited and safe. Given the stench, the agent should consider shooting in the direction of the Wumpus to eliminate the threat. Since the Wumpus is adjacent to (7, 2), the agent should shoot down.

2025-03-27 13:44:37 - LLM Raw Response:
Reasoning: The current position is (7, 2) with a stench indicating a Wumpus in an adjacent square. The last visited position was (7, 1) where a breeze was detected, suggesting a nearby pit. The possible moves are right to (0, 2), left to (6, 2), up to (7, 3), and down to (7, 1). Moving down to (7, 1) is not advisable due to the previous breeze indicating a pit nearby. Moving right to (0, 2) is a safe, unvisited option. Moving left to (6, 2) is also a safe, unvisited option. Moving up to (7, 3) is a safe, unvisited option. Since there is a stench indicating a Wumpus, it is wise to consider shooting in the direction of the Wumpus. However, without a clear direction, it is safer to explore unvisited squares first.

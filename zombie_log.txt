----------------------------------------
Reasoning: Currently at (3, 0) with 15 shots left. The goal is to avoid zombies and collaborate with humans. Moving right to (0, 0) would lead to a dead end, and shooting left or right would waste shots. Moving up to (3, 1) is a viable option as it leads to a new unexplored area, potentially closer to humans.

----------------------------------------
Reasoning: Currently, I am in a relatively safe position at (1, 2) with 15 shots left. Moving right to (2, 2) would keep me in a central position, maintaining a balance between offensive and defensive capabilities. Moving left to (0, 2) or down to (1, 1) would place me closer to the edges, potentially making me more vulnerable to attacks. Moving up to (1, 3) would also place me near the

[03-28 00:21:31.603] Agent 6 LLM response:
----------------------------------------
Reasoning: Currently at (2, 3) with 15 shots left, I need to move towards the goal while avoiding zombies. Moving right to (3, 3) would place me at the far right corner, which is risky as it limits my escape routes. Moving left to (1, 3) would place me closer to the center, providing more escape routes. Moving up to (2, 0) or down to (2, 2) would keep me in

----------------------------------------
Reasoning: Currently at (3,0) with 15 shots left, I need to move towards the safe zone. Moving right to (3,1) will bring me closer to the center of the grid, which is a safer area. Moving up to (3,1) is the best option as it brings me closer to the center of the grid, which is a safer area. Moving down to (3,3) would take me to the bottom right corner, which is a

[03-28 00:21:47.105] Agent 8 LLM response:
----------------------------------------
Reasoning: Currently at (2,2) with 24 shots left, I need to avoid zombies and collaborate with humans. Moving right to (3,2) would be risky as it's close to the edge and might limit future movement. Moving left to (1,2) or down to (2,1) would also be risky as they are close to the edge. Moving up to (2,3) seems safer as it keeps me away from the edge. Shooting doesn't seem necessary

Reasoning: Currently at (3,2) with 24 shots left, I need to avoid zombies and collaborate with humans. Moving right to (3,2) keeps me in the same row, avoiding immediate danger. Moving left to (2,2) or down to (3,1) would also keep me in the same row, but moving up to (3,3) would place me in a corner, potentially isolating me from other agents. Moving right to (0,

[03-28 00:21:56.848] Agent 3 LLM response:
----------------------------------------
Reasoning: Currently at (0, 0) with 15 shots left. The goal is to survive and collaborate with humans. The chat history indicates a focus on staying safe and finding a safe zone. Moving right to (1, 0) seems a reasonable first step as it is a straightforward move towards the goal without significant risk. 

Command: right

[03-28 00:22:02.345] Agent 6 LLM response:
----------------------------------------
Reasoning: Currently at (3, 3) with 15 shots left, I need to consider my options carefully. Moving right would lead to (0, 3), which is a dead-end cell. Moving left would lead to (2, 3), which is a valid cell. Moving up would lead to (3, 0), which is a valid cell. Moving down would lead to (3, 2), which is a valid cell. I should avoid dead-end cells

Reasoning: Currently, I am at (1, 0) with 11 shots left. My goal is to stay safe and collaborate with other agents. The possible moves from (1, 0) are 'right' to (2, 0), 'left' to (0, 0), 'up' to (1, 1), and 'down' to (1, 3). I need to avoid filler words and act intelligently. I should consider the potential risks

The possible moves from (1, 0) are 'right': (2, 0), 'left': (0, 0), 'up': (1, 1), 'down': (1, 3). Moving 'right' to (2, 0) would bring the agent closer to other agents, which could

Reasoning: Currently at (0, 3), I need to avoid zombies and find resources. Moving right to (1, 3) keeps me in the same row, avoiding immediate danger. Moving left to (3, 3) would place me in the last column, potentially isolating me from other agents. Moving up to (0, 0) would take me back to the starting position, which might be risky as zombies could be nearby. Moving down to (0,

Reasoning: The current position is (1, 0) with 11 shots left. The goal is to stay alive and collaborate with other agents. The possible moves from (1, 0) are right (2, 0), left (0, 0), up (1, 1), and down (1, 3). Moving right to (2, 0) would put us in a position to potentially collaborate with other agents, as suggested by the chat history.
